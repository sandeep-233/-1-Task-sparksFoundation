# Task-01 SparksFoundation

## GRIPJUN22 Internship Project
## Task1 - Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

Aim - Predict the precentage of students based on the number of study hours using Supervised Learning

In this we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
